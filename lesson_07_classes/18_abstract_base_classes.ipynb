    "# Abstract Base Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two issues with our example.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. we can create insatances of the `Stream` class and call the `open` method on them. This is an issue because the `Stream` class is supposed to be an abstract concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. both the `FileStream` and the `NetworkStream` classes have a `read` method. If later we define a new stream we need to remember to implement a `read` method and call it **read** (for consistency). We currently don't have any way in which to implement a common interface for different kinds of streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "This issues can be solved by making Stream an *Abstract Base Class*. To do this, we need to import the `ABC` class and the `abstractmethod` function from the `abc` module. We'll have the `Stream` class inherit from the `ABC` class to solve the first issue, and we'll define an empty `read` method in the `Stream` class and flag it with the `@abstractmethod` decorator to signal that all classes that inherit from the `Stream` class, must have a `read` method."
