    "# Multi-level inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "We can keep adding parent - child classes for as long as we want. This is called multi-level inheritance. But you whould avoid it past the 2nd or 3rd level. For example, here we define an Animal class, a Bird class that inherits from the Animal class, and a Chicken class that inherits from the Bird class. Seems logical to build a class inheritance flow like this, but chickens can't fly!!"
