    "# Duck Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve polymorphism we started by defining a base class with an abstract method. But since Python is dynamicly typed we don't really need the `UIControl` base class. This stems from the fact that we never specify a type for the `controls` parameter in the `draw` function. As long as it is itearble and it's iitems have a `draw` method, Python will not crush. This is called *Duck Typing*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not mean that having a base abstract class is a bad practice. To the contrary it's a good one since it enforces a common interface across it's derivative classes."
